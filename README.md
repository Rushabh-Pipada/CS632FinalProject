This is the Teachable Machine Project based on Google's Teachable Machine. It is able to recognize images captured
by a webcam and make a prediction with confidence. 

It can record multiple classes using teach_me.py and prediction can be made using file see_what_i_know.py

teach_me.py can do the following things:
1. Record Multiple classes
2. RESET all the learning if you want the maching to unlearn
3. DONE if all the learning is done and you want to start pre-processing the images

see_what_i_know.py will predict with confidence in terms of the images captured.
